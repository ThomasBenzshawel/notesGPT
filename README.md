https://research.ibm.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-RAG

The project goal is to create an RAG model that can have highly flexible domain knowldege.

All instensive computations are done on MSOE's HPC cluster "ROSIE" https://www.msoe.edu/about-msoe/news/details/meet-rosie/

# Timeline

- [x] Understand transformers
- [ ] Understand GPT models
- [ ] Develop a way to replicate the "chat" experience that comes with chat-gpt
- [ ] Use a "semantic search engine" to find files that contain info related to a search (similar to google's page rank system)
- [ ] Combine a fine tuned GPT model to a specific data set with a semantic search engine
- [ ] Test the results
